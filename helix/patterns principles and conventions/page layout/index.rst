Page layout
-----------

The dynamic layout engine of Sitecore is one of most significant
features of the system. When designing the user experience or
information architecture of a Sitecore powered website, this should be
kept in mind.

Many of the unique tools and features in the Sitecore platform, such as
the Experience Editor with built in personalization and MV testing
capabilities, rely on the dynamic layout engine and the definition of
Layouts, Renderings and Placeholders.

The balance between flexibility – allowing the editors to dynamically
construct the pages by placing feature renderings in placeholders – and
consistency – having a coherent visual design and user experience across
pages – needs to be found in all implementations. Swing too far in one
direction and the user experience may be hurt, swing too far in the
other direction and the business might end up with a rigid and
inflexible solution that frustrates users, or lessens the return of
investment by not supporting the full capabilities of the Sitecore
platform.
