Visual Design and Theming
-------------------------

The user experience, in particular the visual design in an
implementation, is the part of an implementation likely to change the
most frequently. Often this area involves separate technologies,
separate qualifications from Sitecore and ASP.NET and sometimes even
separate development teams.

Therefore, this area often needs special attention in the architectural
phase â€“ emphasized by the specific business requirements of the greater
implementation, for example multi-tenancy, multi-site, marketing
maturity and so on.
