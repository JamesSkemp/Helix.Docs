Security and workflows
----------------------

Security, i.e. what access editors have to features, pages, content,
languages, workflows, fields etc. can be set extremely granularly in
Sitecore.

How granularly you will need to set workflows or security in your
application is entirely up to the business requirements, but there are
some aspects to workflows and rights to be cautious of if you want to
preserve the references between layers, the decoupling between modules
and any multi-tenant requirements.
