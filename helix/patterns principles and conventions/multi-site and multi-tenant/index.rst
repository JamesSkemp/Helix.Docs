Multi-site and multi-tenant
---------------------------

One of the exciting parts of building Sitecore implementations is the
flexibility it offers to solve pretty much any business requirement.
There is a great range of choice when it comes to putting together the
content and information architecture to suit the business. This includes
the ability for a single Sitecore implementation to host multiple
tenants, sites and channels.

Even though Sitecore does not natively support a Tenant context, the
separation between multi-site and multi-tenant is important, as
multi-tenancy introduces a whole new level of governance which needs to
be considered both in the architecture and in the managing organisation.
