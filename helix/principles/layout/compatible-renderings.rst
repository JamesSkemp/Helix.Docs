Compatible renderings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compatibility between different renderings are typically defined by
business rules in the solution, such as whether they can share the same
datasource and whether they can be placed in the same placeholder.

In Helix, compatible renderings are renderings which have identical
datasources (or no datasources) and placed in the same module. These
conventions ensure that there will be no unwanted dependencies between
feature modules from Compatible Renderings fields.
